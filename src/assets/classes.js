              For the sake of finishing ES6 classes in time, they were deliberately designed to be “maximally minimal”.
              That’s why you can currently only create static methods, getters, and setters, but not static data properties.
              There is a proposal for adding them to the language.

                    The new.target pseudo-property lets you detect whether a function or constructor
                    was called using the new operator. In constructors and functions invoked using
                    the new operator, new.target returns a reference to the constructor or
                    function. In normal function calls, new.target is undefined.
